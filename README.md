In this set of projects I take a deep dive into fundamental OOP concepts in Python.

I learn to use libraries and packages to just quickly build the entire coffee machine i built on Day 15. 
(P.S. This was just a hell of a lot faster because I ended up finishing everything in about 20 minutes because I had eveything at my fingertips.)

I love libraries and I'm absolutely looking forward to working with more from other devs 😍😍😍
